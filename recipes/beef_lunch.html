    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Got beef? This recipe is something I eat this nearly five times a week and never tire
        of it. It features clean ingredients, but sacrifices no taste. It can also easily be portioned down depending 
        on your caloric and macronutrient needs.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>2 Grass fed beef patties</li>

        <li>1/2 avocado</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Seasoning for beef (I use special s**t)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
