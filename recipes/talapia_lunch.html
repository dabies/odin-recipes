    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Things are getting a little fishy around here! This talapia lunch is a perfect
        source of lean protein. A great meal for someone looking to cut fat, but keep from losing
        that hard earned muscle! This was a favorite of mine when I was in the "weight cutting" phase
        of my last offseason.
