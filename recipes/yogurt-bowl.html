    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is one of my favorite light lunches. It's easy to make, and incredibly tasty. It is also full of great 
        nutrients, and can be customized to be lower or higer calories depending on the quantity of some of the ingredients.
        I recommend experimenting with quantities and not just using what I do, as I am a large(6'8, 260lbs) professional 
        athlete with high caloric needs. I will list the exact ingredients that I use for this bowl, as they are clean
        and healthy.
